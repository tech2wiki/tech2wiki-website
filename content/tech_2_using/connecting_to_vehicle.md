# Connecting to a vehicle

The Tech2 can be connected to a car using the supplied cable, and one of the adapters. The most common is the [http://odbii.com OBD-II] port, which also supplies battery power to the Tech2.

The Tech 2 receives power through the DLC cable connection to vehicles equipped with On-Board Diagnostics (OBD II). In the case of vehicles not equipped with OBD II, an external power source (i.e. using vehicle cigarette lighter or external AC/DC converter) must be used.

## CANdi

Cars with CANbus also require the CANdi module to be inserted in the cable inline, between the Tech2 and the car's OBD-II port. Some instructions warn to be careful not to connect the CANdi when it is not necessary (or omit it when it is) or risk damaging it, or the Tech2.
